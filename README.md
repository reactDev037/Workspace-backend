# Asteroid Workspace

Each Workspace manages a directory of Asteroid Projects for a user, team, or organization. Workspace can be used either
programmatically, or through a built-in REST interface.

## Running the REST server

After cloning the Workspace repository, run the following:

    node workspace --root `~/my-asteroid-workspace`

Of course, this example assumes the repo is cloned at `./workspace`, and that the desired root directory for projects is
`~/my-asteroid-workspace`. Please make any appropriate changes for your own use.

## Using Workspaces programmatically
